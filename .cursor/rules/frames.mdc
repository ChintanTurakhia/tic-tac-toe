# Farcaster Mini Apps

## Docs

- [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started): Mini apps are web apps built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript that can be discovered
  and used within Farcaster clients. You can use an SDK to access native
  Farcaster features, like authentication, sending notifications, and interacting
  with the user's wallet.
- [Specification](/docs/specification): A Mini App is a web application that renders inside a Farcaster client.
- [Authenticating users](/docs/guides/auth): An app can use the [signIn](/docs/sdk/actions/sign-in) to get a [Sign in with
  Farcaster (SIWF)](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/siwf/) authentication credential for the user.
- [Loading your app](/docs/guides/loading): When users open Mini Apps in Farcaster they are shown a branded splash screen
  instead of a blank loading page like they would in a browser. Once your interface
  is ready to show the splash screen can be hidden.
- [Sending Notifications](/docs/guides/notifications): Mini Apps can send notifications to users who have added the Mini App to
  their Farcaster client and enabled notifications.
- [Publishing your app](/docs/guides/publishing): Publishing Mini Apps involves providing information like who developed the app,
  how it should be displayed, and what its capabilities are.
- [Sharing your app](/docs/guides/sharing): Mini Apps can be shared in social feeds using special embeds that let users
  interact with an app directly from their feed.
- [Interacting with Wallets](/docs/guides/wallets): Mini Apps can interact with a user's crypto wallet without needing to worry
  about popping open "select your wallet" dialogs or flakey connections.
- [What's New](/docs/sdk/changelog): Added `noindex` field to manifest (see [discussions/204](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/miniapps/discussions/204))
- [Context](/docs/sdk/context): When your app is opened it can access information about the session from
  `sdk.context`. This object provides basic information about the user, the
  client, and where your app was opened from:
- [Client Events](/docs/sdk/events): When a user interacts with your app events will be sent from the Farcaster
  client to your application client.
- [Wallet](/docs/sdk/wallet): ![users taking onchain action from app](/transaction-preview.png)
- [addFrame](/docs/sdk/actions/add-frame): Prompts the user to add the app.
- [close](/docs/sdk/actions/close): Closes the mini app.
- [composeCast](/docs/sdk/actions/compose-cast): Open the cast composer with a suggested cast. The user will be able to modify
  the cast before posting it.
- [openUrl](/docs/sdk/actions/open-url): Opens an external URL.
- [ready](/docs/sdk/actions/ready): Hides the Splash Screen. Read the [guide on loading your app](/docs/guides/loading) for best practices.
- [signIn](/docs/sdk/actions/sign-in): Request a [Sign in with Farcaster
  (SIWF)](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/siwf/) credential from the user.
- [viewProfile](/docs/sdk/actions/view-profile): Displays a user's Farcaster profile.
